### Trenitalia's mobile app
Following some informations about trenitalia's app.
Trenitalia mobile app's developer adopted a security measure called SSL pinning, making impossible to intercept HTTPS traffic with a man-in-the-middle approach using a non rooted device.
Trenitalia mobile app uses Retrofit to implement the api, both for data managing and UI purposes, such as displaying a view populated with datas.
